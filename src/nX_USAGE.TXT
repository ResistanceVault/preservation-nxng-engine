I] nX USAGE RULES
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1 - InitFXs ***MUST*** be called before any call to LoadLWS!!!



II] CODE RULES
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) Displacement EFFECTORS:
--------------------------

	Next apply to:		nX_MDPlug.cpp [nX_Entity::LoadMDD(), nX_Entity::ApplyMDD()]

Such effectors discard 'edge_adress' pointer to original mesh datas and move it to 'oMesh'.
Effectors loading code MUST put back correct values to 'edge_adress' because several routines
rely on the original mesh datas like the UVMapper.

IN A SCENE NOT USING SUCH EFFECTORS 'oMesh' REMAINS NULL!

NOTE: This do not apply to face and edge normal pointers wich are ALWAYS respectively stored
in 'ofacenormals' and 'oedgenormals' pointers right after they've been computed.

NOTE2: Such effectors usually make their calculations BEFORE the original mesh normals gets
computed.


2) nX Class TexMap Linked List:
-------------------------------

Any time a texture is loaded by a scene it is added to the scene's linked list AND to the
parent nX instance linked list.
TexMap are shared among scenes belonging to the same nX instance.
TexMap use the 'RefCount method' used in COM objects (not an MS invention though...) to
determine wether it can delete the texmap or if it is still used by another scene belonging
to its parent nX instance.

nX_TexMap.RefCount is a 32bit wide unsigned integer to avoid any problems with poorly written
code such as a particle systems... Note: nX Native Particle System uses surface to store
particles materials so it never refere more than once to a texture.


3) 'Per-frame' normal computing:
--------------------------------

Some effectors such as [WAVE], METABALLS or general ISOSURFACES modify the original mesh
thus making normals for it wrong.

In order to accelerate the process of computing edge normals set the nX_Entity member
'perframenormalcalc' to true.
